# StoryCoherence
### ‚ú®Introduction 

In an age where data storytelling plays a crucial role in decision-making, education, and communication, the ability to create a clear, coherent narrative in the right order from existing graph is an important skill for everyone. While many tools focus on helping users generate visualizations, there is little support in guiding how to structure those insights into a compelling, logical flow.
Students and early-stage analysts often struggle not with generating insights, but with organizing them in a way that makes sense to others. 
A well-structured story helps highlight key findings, emphasizes causality, and enhances understanding ‚Äî but without coherence, even the most powerful insights can lose their impact.

StoryCoherence aims to tackle this challenge by designing a system that:
- Measures the coherence of a data story ‚Äî modeled as a sequence of visual-insight pairs.
- Recommends optimal sequencing to help users build clearer, more compelling stories.
  
By applying AI and natural language processing techniques to evaluate the semantic relationships between insights, this project bridges the gap between data and narrative ‚Äî ultimately empowering better communication, critical thinking, and learning outcomes.
### üéØObjective 
Design an algorithmic approach to 
- measuring coherence of a data stories which is a sequence of data insights (data visualizations), each represented by a collection of sentencing describing the plots
- provide sequencing recommendation for students during story construction process
